## SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

Application of reference frameworks and models (TOGAF, 4+1 Views, C4 Model) for structuring enterprise and system architectures. Creation of architectural artifacts: context, component, deployment, information, and concurrency diagrams; documentation of decisions (ADRs) and app catalogs. Use of architectural patterns and styles (Microservices, Event-Driven Architectures, API Gateway, Service Mesh, MVC) to design scalable, secure, and highly available solutions. Design of architectural evolution processes (AS-IS/TO-BE) and analysis of quality trade-offs (performance, security, availability, scalability). Implementation of architecture experiments to validate hypotheses associated with significant requirements (ASRs), applying tests for performance, latency, resilience, and security. Integration of agile methodologies in architectural design: iterative/incremental documentation, quality scenario experimentation, and business requirements prioritization.
